__How to play__

At random times, an event will start. 
Everyone has 60 seconds to join the quest.

Once the quest starts, there's a chance to encounter mobs.
Once a mob arrives, each turn every player picks their action
(Players who didn't pick an action will be ignored in 60 seconds)

The actions are as follows

{Attack} *Attack*
{Defend} *Defend*
{Flee} *Flee*

Your goal is to destroy the encountered creature.
