# __How to play__

Welcome to RPG-Bot!
Battle for the ages, and level your guild to become the strongest in the land

A quest will appear periodically, everyone in the guild has 60 seconds to join the Adventure.

Once the quest starts, you'll have to fight mighty opponents, the more players join, the harder the fights!
Once you encounter an enemy, you'll be able to pick an action.
The actions are as follows

‚öî *Attack*

üõ° *Defend*

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è *Flee*


Attacking will damage the opponent, the amount will depend on which class you've taken, and what level you've reached in that class.
Defending will block damage from the enemy, the amount also depends on the classes and level.
Fleeing simply removes you from the fight. It will grant you a bit of experience (relative to how much damage has been dealt to the opponent)

Your goal is to destroy the encountered creature, and reach the boss-fight.

You can also hire mercenaries to join the fight. 
Depending on the amount of health you lost, you'll also lose some mercenaries with each encounter.

You can buy more mercenaries with the gold you've earned from defeating enemies.
